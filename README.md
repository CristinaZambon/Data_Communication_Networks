# Data_Communication_Networks
This repository contains all the programming assignments I solved for the course Data Communication Networks 
during my exchange semester at Mississippi State University in Fall 2021. 

1. Basic File Transfer Protocol. 
  The goal of the first assignment is to gain experience with UDP socket programming in a client-server environment by implementing a file transfer protocol.
